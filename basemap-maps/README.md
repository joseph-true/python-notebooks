This repo contains a Jupyter notebook that reproduces the documentation and code examples for the 25+ different types of map projections available in the Basemap Python 2D mapping library.  
The basemap documentation shows these examples all on separate pages so this notebook puts them all in place for easy scrolling and comparison.
